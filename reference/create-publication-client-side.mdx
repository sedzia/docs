This method selects vouchers that are suitable for publication, adds a publish entry and returns the publication.

A voucher is suitable for publication when it's active and hasn't been published yet.

<Warning>
  You must clearly define which source you want to publish the voucher code from. It can either be a code from a campaign or a specific voucher identified by a code.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  In case you want to publish multiple vouchers within a single publication, you need to specify the campaign name and number of vouchers you want to publish.
</Warning>

<Info>
  In case you want to ensure the number of publishable codes increases automatically with the number of customers, you should use an **auto-update** campaign.
