To get a proper and valid response, please send a CSV file with data separated by commas.  \n\n## Request Example\n<!--\ntitle: \"Example Request\"\nlineNumbers: true\n-->\n```cURL\ncurl -X **POST** \\\n  https://api.voucherify.io/v1/customers/importCSV \\\n  -F file=@/path/to/customers.csv \\\n  -H \"X-App-Id: c70a6f00-cf91-4756-9df5-47628850002b\" \\\n  -H \"X-App-Token: 3266b9f8-e246-4f79-bdf0-833929b1380c\"\n```\n## CSV File Format\n\nThe CSV file has to include headers in the first line. All properties which cannot be mapped to standard customer fields will be added to the metadata object.\n\n<!-- theme: info -->\n> ðŸ“˜ Standard customer fields mapping\n>\n> **No spaces allowed in field names**  \n> Id, Name, Email, Phone, Birthdate, Source_id, Address_line_1, Address_line_2, Address_Postal_Code, Address_City, Address_State, Address_Country, Description, Metadata_name_1, Metadata_name_2\n\n## Update Customers using CSV\n\nIf you would like to update customer's data, you can do it using the CSV file with new data. However, remember to include a `source_id` in your CSV file to manage the update successfully.\n\nThis API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk. \n\nIn case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the `IN_PROGRESS` status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window. \n\nThe result will return the async ID. You can verify the status of your request via this [API request](ref:get-async-action).",
